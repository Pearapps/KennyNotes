KennyNotes
==========

KennyNotes uses the following open source components: FCModel, FMDB, MSDCMoreOptionTableViewCell, BVReorderTableView, MSCCellAccessory, KPAKit. Licenses for each respentive component can be found on their github project pages.

KennyNotes was a challenge to feature match another couple notes apps at their v1.x in under 40 hours and I succeeded. And I think it is a a lot better then the apps in many ways as well.

It doesn't have unit tests and it not tested very well but it works for me at the moment and I will fix when it breaks if I give a fuck.

Don't yell at me for writing code to manage relationships between the models. Or anything. Just pull request. Harrassement is not chill chains. k?

Please feel free to fix shit or comment it - just pull request I will most likely accept it if its not strange and is _commented_. All new code must be commented. At least 0.25 comments a line. This is in the read me so please. Please.
